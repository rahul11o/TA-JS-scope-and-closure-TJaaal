Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // Reference Error username is not defined
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.
The above code will throw an error sying `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); //Reference Error username is not defined
```
Variable created with the keyword const inside the block is scoped, hence its uses is limited  only inside the block scope and cannot be accesed from outside.

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // /Reference Error username is not defined.
```
If statement creates block-scope, hence any variable defined inside if statement with the keyword 'let' and 'const' cannot be accessed from outside, if tried, will thrown a referance error.
4. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

6. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

7. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
function sayHello() {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
sayHello();
console.log(useranme); // output
```

8. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // output
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // output
```

9. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // output
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // output
```
